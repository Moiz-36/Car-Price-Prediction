# Car-Price-Prediction
This project builds a car price prediction model using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains details such as fuel type, seller type, transmission, present price, and years of usage, which are preprocessed by encoding categorical values into numerical form. The target variable is the car’s selling price, while other attributes serve as features. The data is split into training and testing sets, and models are trained using Linear Regression and Lasso Regression. Model performance is evaluated with the R² score, achieving strong accuracy on both training and testing data. Scatter plots are generated to compare actual vs. predicted values, providing a clear visualization of model performance. The implementation uses Python libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, demonstrating a practical machine learning workflow for predictive analytics in the automotive domain.
